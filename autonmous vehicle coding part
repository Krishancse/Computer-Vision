1. Sensor Data Processing (Perception):

In this module, you'll collect and process data from various sensors like LiDAR, cameras, radar, GPS, and IMU. You'll then use computer vision and sensor fusion techniques to understand the vehicle's environment.

Python Example - Collecting and Processing Camera Images:



# Import the OpenCV library
import cv2

# Initialize the camera
camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 indicates the default camera, you can change it if you have multiple cameras

while True:
    # Capture a frame from the camera
    ret, frame = camera.read()  # 'ret' is a flag indicating if the frame was successfully captured

    # Check if the frame was successfully captured
    if not ret:
        print("Failed to capture a frame.")
        break

    # Perform image processing (e.g., object detection, lane detection)
    processed_frame = process_image(frame)

    # Send processed data to other modules (e.g., object detection module)
    send_data_to_other_modules(processed_frame)

    # Display the processed frame in a window named 'Processed Frame'
    cv2.imshow('Processed Frame', processed_frame)

    # Exit the loop when 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the camera and close windows
camera.release()  # Release the camera resources
cv2.destroyAllWindows()  # Close all OpenCV windows

# Define the 'process_image' and 'send_data_to_other_modules' functions according to your specific image processing needs
def process_image(frame):
    # Implement your image processing logic here
    # This can include object detection, lane detection, or any other computer vision tasks

    # Return the processed frame
    return processed_frame

def send_data_to_other_modules(processed_frame):
    # Implement code to send the processed data to other modules in your autonomous vehicle system
    pass  # Replace 'pass' with your actual implementation

# The script captures frames from the camera, processes them, and displays the processed frames in real-time.
# Press 'q' to exit the loop and release the camera.




2. Path Planning and Decision-Making:

In this module, you'll determine the vehicle's path and actions based on sensor data, destination, and high-level goals.

Python Example - Simple Path Planning:
def plan_path(current_position, destination):
    # Implement path planning algorithm (e.g., A* or D* algorithm)
    planned_path = a_star_algorithm(current_position, destination)
    return planned_path

# Example usage
start_point = (0, 0)  # Starting position
end_point = (100, 100)  # Destination position

# Call the plan_path function to calculate the path from start to end
path = plan_path(start_point, end_point)

# 'path' now contains the planned path, which is a sequence of waypoints or coordinates that the vehicle should follow to reach the destination.




3. Control:

This module is responsible for controlling the vehicle's actuators (e.g., steering, acceleration, braking) to follow the planned path.

Python Example - Vehicle Control:


def control_vehicle(vehicle_state, desired_state):
    # Implement control algorithms (e.g., PID controllers)
    control_commands = calculate_controls(vehicle_state, desired_state)
    return control_commands

# Example usage
current_state = get_current_vehicle_state()
desired_state = get_desired_vehicle_state()
control_commands = control_vehicle(current_state, desired_state)


4. Localization:

Localization involves estimating the vehicle's position and orientation in the world. It typically combines data from sensors and maps.

Python Example - Sensor Fusion for Localization:

python
Copy code
def sensor_fusion(sensor_data):
    # Implement sensor fusion algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter)
    fused_data = fuse_sensor_data(sensor_data)
    return fused_data

# Example usage
sensor_data = get_sensor_data()
fused_data = sensor_fusion(sensor_data)




 Safety and Fail-Safe Mechanisms:

Implement safety measures, such as emergency braking and collision avoidance, to ensure the vehicle's safety in unexpected situations.

Python Example - Emergency Braking:

python
Copy code
def emergency_brake(sensor_data):
    if danger_detected(sensor_data):
        apply_brakes()
