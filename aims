Certainly, here are some more real-life computer vision projects and devices:

13. **Retail Checkout-Free Stores:** Some retail stores use computer vision and sensor fusion to create cashier-less shopping experiences. Shoppers can grab items and simply walk out of the store while cameras and computer vision algorithms track their selections and automatically charge them.

14. **Emotion Recognition:** Computer vision can be used to analyze facial expressions and gestures to detect human emotions. This technology has applications in market research, customer feedback analysis, and even mental health monitoring.

15. **Automated Sorting in Logistics:** In logistics and shipping, computer vision systems are employed to sort packages based on their size, shape, and destination. This enhances the efficiency of distribution centers.

16. **Real Estate Virtual Tours:** Real estate agencies use computer vision to create virtual tours of properties. These tours provide prospective buyers with a 360-degree view of a property, allowing them to explore it remotely.

17. **Gesture Control Devices:** Consumer electronics, such as gaming consoles and smart TVs, incorporate gesture recognition using computer vision. Users can control devices and interact with content using hand gestures.

18. **Food Quality Inspection:** In the food industry, computer vision is used to inspect and grade the quality of fruits, vegetables, and other food products. It ensures that only high-quality items reach consumers.

19. **Augmented Reality in Education:** Some educational applications use computer vision to create interactive and immersive learning experiences. For example, students can use AR apps to explore historical sites or dissect virtual organisms.

20. **Healthcare Monitoring:** Computer vision can assist in monitoring patients' health. Wearable devices with cameras and computer vision algorithms can track vital signs and detect anomalies.

21. **Traffic Management:** Smart traffic systems use computer vision to monitor traffic flow, detect accidents, and adjust traffic signals in real-time to reduce congestion and improve road safety.

22. **Wildlife Conservation:** Computer vision-equipped cameras are used in the wild to monitor and study animal behavior, population trends, and migration patterns. This data aids in wildlife conservation efforts.

23. **Visual Search Engines:** E-commerce platforms and search engines employ visual search, allowing users to search for products or information by uploading images rather than text.

24. **Humanoid Robots:** Some humanoid robots, like Pepper, are equipped with computer vision capabilities to interact with humans more naturally. They can recognize faces, emotions, and gestures to engage in conversations and provide assistance.

25. **Security and Surveillance:** In addition to facial recognition, computer vision is used for video analytics in security systems. It can detect suspicious activities, intrusions, and anomalies in real-time video feeds.
